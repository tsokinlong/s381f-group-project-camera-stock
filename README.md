This application provide a interface create and manage a camera stock, and retreive the data from the database and display on specific page. Also provide corresponding url for RESTful api access.

This app using cookie session (used in Lab7) to persist user session.

By default, when user hit the root `"/"` url without authentication, the website will redirect user to `"/login"` page.

There are two user login data is hard coded at the begin of the script.

```js
const users = [
  { name: "admin", password: "admin" },
  { name: "user", password: "user" },
];
```

You can use the one you like to fill in the login form on the `"/login"` page.

Without the session, user cannot access the root `"/"` page.

You can test the session by `console.log(session);` in the `app.get("/")` request.

If incorrect data is provided, user will redirect to `"/login"` page again with parameter `?status=error` and the error message show above the login form.
